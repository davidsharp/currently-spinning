# currently-spinning :musical_note:
A (macOS only) widget for presenting the Now Playing Spotify track, with a few controls

### How to "install"

```
git clone https://github.com/davidsharp/currently-spinning.git
cd currently-spinning
yarn # `npm install` also works
```

### How to run
This widget depends on Spotify running (as it interfaces with it using AppleScript), then from terminal run `yarn start` (or `npm start` if that's your jam)

## What can this widget do?
It looks pretty, and controls your music ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

You can control Spotify through currently-spinning using media keys (these will need to be approved through the `System Preferences>Security & Privacy>Accessibility`), but it can also handle clicks (left-side is previous track, right-side is next track, middle is play/pause)
